# Northcoders News API

## Project Summary

The Northcoders News API is a RESTful API that serves as the backend for a news application. It provides structured access to articles, users, comments, and topics, allowing clients to create, update, retrieve and delete data (CRUD).

This project was built using Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL, following best practices for RESTful API design. It includes full database integration, testing with Jest, and deployment via Render.

## Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the NC News repository to your local machine:

```
git clone <https://github.com/your-username/nc-news.git>
```

Change directory into your newly cloned repo:

```
cd nc-news
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en) and [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.w3schools.com/postgresql/postgresql_install.php) installed before proceeding. Then, install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
npm install
```

### 3. Setting Up Environment Variables

> _Under normal circumstances, I know `.env.` details wouldn't be shared, but for the sake of this project, I will be disclosing below:_

You will need to create two `.env` files to store database connection details:

`.env.development` file (for development database):

```
PGDATABASE=nc_news
```

`.env.test` file (for test database):

```
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Ensure that your `.gitignore` file includes `.env.*` and `node_modules` to prevent these files from being pushed to GitHub.

### 4. Creating Databases

Once the `.env` files are created, set up and seed the database using:

```
npm run setup-dbs
npm run seed
```

### 5. Seeding the Databases

To seed the test database and check the setup, run:

```
npm run test-seed
```

To seed the development database, run:

```
npm run seed-dev
```

### 6. Verifying the Setup

Run the test suite to check if your tables are set up correctly:

```
npm run test-seed
```

üëç If all tests pass, your database is successfully seeded!
